<h1>Exercise: Set up the MySQL instance server in MySQL Workbench</h1>
<h3>Scenario</h3>
<p>Little Lemon needs to build a robust relational database system in MySQL to store large amounts of data which they can also easily manage and locate as required. Little Lemon have decided to use MySQL Workbench to develop their new database system. They need you to help them set up their MySQL environment to prepare for the design and development of their database.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>MySQL Workbench must already be downloaded and installed on your machine.</p> 

<h3>Task Instructions</h3>
<p>Complete the following tasks to help Little Lemon set up their MySQL environment.</p> 

<h5>Task 1</h5>
<p>Creating a new user is the most secure way to connect to your MySQL database. In this first task, you need to use MySQL Workbench to create a new user account.</p> 
<p>Here is some guidance for completing this task:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Log in to the MySQL Server using the root user.</li>
    <li>Select Administration tab from the Navigator section.</li>
    <li>Select Add account.</li> 
    <li>Provide a meaningful username and a strong password.</li>
    <li>Grant the new user the right to perform all tasks.</li>
</ul> 
<h5>Task 2</h5>
<p>To prepare for building and managing your database, you need to be connected to a MySQL server. In this task you need to create a new MySQL connection.</p>
<p>Here is some guidance for completing this task:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In the MySQL Workbench home screen, select MySQL connection tab.</li> 
    <li>Select the plus icon to open the Setup New Connection form.</li> 
    <li>Fill in the form to create a new server instance.</li> 
    <li>Click the Test Connection button to check that the settings work as required.</li> 
</ul>
<p>Once you have completed this task, you can use this connection to begin working with database schemas and SQL queries.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you created a new user account and an instance server. You are now ready to develop a suitable database system for Little Lemon.</p>
