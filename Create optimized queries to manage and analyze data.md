# Create optimized queries to manage and analyze data

### Scenario

Little Lemon need to query the data in their database. To do this, they need your help with creating optimized queries using stored procedures and prepared statements.

### Task 1

In this first task, Little Lemon need you to create a procedure that displays the maximum ordered quantity in the Orders table. 

Creating this procedure will allow Little Lemon to reuse the logic implemented in the procedure easily without retyping the same code over again and again to check the maximum quantity. 

You can call the procedure GetMaxQuantity and invoke it as follows:

``` 
CREATE PROCEDURE GetMaxQuantity()  
SELECT MAX(Quantity) AS 'Max QUantity in Order'
FROM 'orders';

CALL GetMaxQuantity();
```

# Task 2
In the second task, Little Lemon need you to help them to create a prepared statement called GetOrderDetail. This prepared statement will help to reduce the parsing time of queries. It will also help to secure the database from SQL injections.

The prepared statement should accept one input argument, the CustomerID value, from a variable. 

The statement should return the order id, the quantity and the order cost from the Orders table.â€¯

Once you create the prepared statement, you can create a variable called id and assign it value of 1. 

Then execute the GetOrderDetail prepared statement using the following syntax:

``` 
PREPARE GetOrderDetail FROM 'SELECT OrderId, Quantity, TotalCost FROM `orders` WHERE OrderId = ?';

SET @id = 1;
EXECUTE GetOrderDetail USING @id;
``` 

# Task 3

Your third and final task is to create a stored procedure called CancelOrder. Little Lemon want to use this stored procedure to delete an order record based on the user input of the order id.
